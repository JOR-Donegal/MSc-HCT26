# Week 5
We need to plan our backup strategy before we put any system live. And much more than backup, identify how could we fully recreate this system and restore any live data to it.

This week we're going to do some reading on the subject of
- Backup and restore
- Business continuity
- Disaster recovery

As always my notes are light and a starting point only. You need to read deeply.
The practical exercise this week is also very light, but it is a required skill.

## Study
Read through my notes on [Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery](https://jor-donegal.github.io/BCandDR26/), make sure you can define and distinguish between all the terms.

## Practical Work
Using the domain controller for electric-petrol (which you should have!) carry out [this exercise](https://jor-donegal.github.io/BackupExercise26/).
