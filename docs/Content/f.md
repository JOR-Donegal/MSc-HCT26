# Week 6
You already have a good background in hypervisors and the associated terminology. This week we are going to look into Microsoft's Hyper-V.

# Study
1. Do some independent research! Do some background reading this week and understand the function of Microsoft's Virtual Machine Manager (VMM). I will NOT ask you to implement this.

# Practical Work
This week I want you do do some tasks in [Hyper-V Clusters](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/hct-practice/hyper-v).
